Given an m * n matrix M initialized with all 0's and several update operations.

Operations are represented by a 2D array, and each operation is represented by an array with two positive integers a and b, which means M[i][j] should be added by one for all 0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b.

You need to count and return the number of maximum integers in the matrix after performing all the operations.

**题目:**

**给出一个 m*n的二维矩阵，初始化为0。根据operation给其中一部分区域加1，operation为是二维数组M[i][j]，并且0 <= i < a and 0 <= j < b，最后要返回叠加区域最大值的个数。**

**Example 1:**
	
	Input: 
	m = 3, n = 3
	operations = [[2,2],[3,3]]
	Output: 4
	Explanation: 
	Initially, M = 
	[[0, 0, 0],
	 [0, 0, 0],
	 [0, 0, 0]]
	
	After performing [2,2], M = 
	[[1, 1, 0],
	 [1, 1, 0],
	 [0, 0, 0]]
	
	After performing [3,3], M = 
	[[2, 2, 1],
	 [2, 2, 1],
	 [1, 1, 1]]
	
	So the maximum integer in M is 2, and there are four of it in M. So return 4.

**思路：**
操作数的矩阵叠加范围从0,0点开始，所以每次叠加记录i,j的最小值，便是最多叠加次数的范围。


**Code:**

	/**
	 * @param {number} m
	 * @param {number} n
	 * @param {number[][]} ops
	 * @return {number}
	 */
	var maxCount = function(m, n, ops) {
		let i=null;
	    for( i in ops){
	    	m=Math.min(m,ops[i][0]);
	    	n=Math.min(n,ops[i][1]);
	    }
	    return m*n;
	};
