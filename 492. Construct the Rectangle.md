For a web developer, it is very important to know how to design a web page's size. So, given a specific rectangular web page’s area, your job by now is to design a rectangular web page, whose length L and width W satisfy the following requirements:

1. The area of the rectangular web page you designed must equal to the given target area.

2. The width W should not be larger than the length L, which means L >= W.

3. The difference between length L and width W should be as small as possible.
You need to output the length L and the width W of the web page you designed in sequence.

**题目：** 大意：给出一个目标面积数字S，得出规定的长L和宽W。
要求:
1. S=L*W，即面积等于长和宽的积。
2. L>=W，长要大于等于宽。
3. 长和宽的差距应该尽可能小。

函数返回长和宽的数组。
**Example:**

	Input: 4
	Output: [2, 2]
	Explanation: The target area is 4, and all the possible ways to construct it are [1,4], [2,2], [4,1]. 
	But according to requirement 2, [1,4] is illegal; according to requirement 3,  [4,1] is not optimal compared to [2,2]. So the length L is 2, and the width W is 2.



**Code:**

	/**
	 * @param {number} area
	 * @return {number[]}
	 */
	let constructRectangle = function(area) {
		let arr=[];
	    let w=parseInt(Math.sqrt(area));
	    while(area%w!=0){
	    	w--;
		}
		arr.push(area/w);
		arr.push(w);
		return arr;
	};
